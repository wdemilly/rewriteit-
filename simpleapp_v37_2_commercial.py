Commercial Fiction Chapter Harness — Quality-First + Score-Gated Pipeline
=========================================================================
Generate commercial-fiction chapter drafts and ship TOP 1 only after commercial-quality selection, local-score gate, and optional Stage G repair.
v16 adds Stage F: a ridge-regression predictor of the Originality human-score,
fit on labeled_corpus.json and run on the final shipped text. No API call; the
ridge lives inline. Output is a predicted score (0–100) and a recommendation
band (SHIP / RECONSIDER / REGENERATE). Advisory — does not gate shipping.
v17 adds Stage G: a line-edit pass that runs on the final shipped text.
G1 is a mechanical copyedit — one LLM call with strict punctuation-only
instructions and a word-sequence invariant check that rejects any edit that
changed words (not just punctuation). G2 is a deterministic AI-tell scan
against a module-level word list (starting with "particular" / "particularly").
G3 resolves each flagged sentence with a three-behavior cascade: (a) same-beat
graft from a runner-up acceptable draft where possible; (b) mechanical
deletion with a/an article repair where deletion leaves the sentence intact;
(c) flag for manual rewrite when neither path applies. Stage G writes
FINAL_<batch_stub>_LINEEDITED.txt and a LINEEDIT_REPORT_<batch_stub>.txt
audit file alongside the existing FINAL outputs. Stage F's prediction
subsequently runs on the line-edited text when one was produced.
v25 expands Stage G into a copy-edit pass against the v19 outline's residual
leak patterns. AI_TELL_WORDS grows from two single-word entries into a
construction catalogue with two entry classes: deletable single-word hedges
(particular, particularly, merely) and graft-only sentence-internal
constructions (as though, as if, conditional similes "as a man might,"
"the way [pron]" variants v19 enumerated, "of a [noun] who" portrait
constructions, "the kind of [X] that" classifiers, "the noise/sound a X
makes" sense-perception variants). Graft-only entries use a GRAFT_ONLY
sentinel in the replacement slot; G3b deletion is skipped for those because
removing the construction would damage the sentence — they fall through to
G3a graft and then to G3c manual flag if no clean graft is available.
v25 also adds G4: a single LLM call after G3 over the whole post-G3 text,
deletion-only, targeting three multi-sentence patterns that escape
sentence-by-sentence flagging — negation triplets running across consecutive
sentences, closing aphoristic gloss at scene/paragraph ends, and classify-
by-genre constructions that survived G3. G4 is protected by three invariants
(±2% word-count band, no whole-paragraph deletion, deletion-only word-set
check). Audit entries from G4 are appended to the same LINEEDIT_REPORT file.
v36.27 REPLACES Stage G's invocation model. The Stage G machinery
(run_mechanical_copyedit, find_ai_tell_sentences, try_same_beat_graft,
run_g4_multisentence_pass, and the orchestrating run_line_edit_pass) is
preserved unchanged at the code level. What changes is *when* it runs.
In v25 Stage G ran unconditionally inside run_pipeline regardless of any
AI-detection signal. In v36.27 STAGE_G_ENABLED is False at module level,
which short-circuits the unconditional call. A new local-scorer pass
(band_classifier + extended_band_features + local_scorer, fit to the
operator's 38-export corpus at LOO r=0.944, RMSE 5.17) runs on
final_text and produces a predicted Originality.ai turbo score in
[0, 100]. The score selects one of three actions:
  - score >= SCORE_SHIP (default 95)  → ship as-is (v25 behavior)
  - SCORE_STAGE_G_LOW (default 85) <= score < SCORE_SHIP
                                       → explicitly invoke
                                         run_line_edit_pass with
                                         force_enable=True, then
                                         re-score the edited text
  - score < SCORE_STAGE_G_LOW          → flag the result for batch
                                         regeneration (no Stage G —
                                         a draft this far off-target
                                         is not a copyedit fix)
v36.27 also wraps the main "Generate & Evaluate" button in a regeneration
loop of up to MAX_REGEN_ITERATIONS (default 8). Each iteration that fails
to produce a ship-band result bumps the temperature by TEMP_BUMP_PER_ITER
(default +0.1) and regenerates the batch. On cap exhaustion the best
draft found across iterations is surfaced with a clear below-ship marker.
The four local-scorer support files (band_classifier.py,
extended_band_features.py, local_scorer.py, calibration.json) must sit
beside this script for the new flow to work. If any of them is missing or
fails to import, the v37 commercial fork produces review artifacts but does
not mark the result shipped. The calibrated local scorer is treated as a
red-light dependency for commercial client-facing output.
v36.28 makes Stage G accountable for its results. In v36.27 the Stage G
band (85 <= pred < 95) had two outcomes: post_g >= 95 → ship the edited
text; otherwise → mark for regen and surface the edited text anyway. The
second branch was unprincipled: if Stage G hurt the score (pre_g 91.9,
post_g 88), the loop still committed Stage G's edits to final_text_
lineedited, Stage F was scored on the damaged text, GitHub received the
damaged file, and a cap-exhausted run could surface the damaged draft as
"best observed" even though the pre-G text scored higher.
v36.28 replaces that branch with three sub-cases driven by the delta
between pre_g_score and post_g_score:
  - post_g >= SCORE_SHIP                  → STAGE_G_THEN_SHIP
                                            (unchanged from v36.27;
                                            Stage G's edits cleared the
                                            bar, ship the lineedited text)
  - pre_g < post_g < SCORE_SHIP           → STAGE_G_KEEP_EDITS_REGEN
                                            (new; Stage G helped but
                                            didn't clear the bar; keep
                                            the edits as the iter's
                                            best-observed text and
                                            continue the regen loop)
  - post_g <= pre_g (Stage G hurt or
                     no-op)               → STAGE_G_REVERT_REGEN
                                            (new; discard Stage G's
                                            edits entirely; the iter's
                                            best-observed text is the
                                            pre-G final_text; continue
                                            the regen loop)
The pre <= post equality case routes to REVERT because Stage G changed
text without earning a score improvement; the edits are not justified.
Under STAGE_G_REVERT_REGEN the result dict does NOT set final_text_
lineedited (rather than setting it and clearing it), which keeps
downstream consumers (Stage F prediction, debug labels, display text,
GitHub push) naturally pointed at the pre-G text. The Stage G audit
data (line_edit dict, pre/post scores, decision label) is preserved in
the result for diagnostic value, but the lineedit's edited_path and
report_path are NOT included in the iter's files_to_push list when the
decision is REVERT — those files exist on disk for audit but should not
be surfaced as canonical outputs.
The iter_score that drives best-observed tracking in the regen loop is
also updated. v36.27 used max(pre_g, post_g) unconditionally; v36.28
computes it from the decision so it reflects the score of the text the
iter is actually offering: pre_g for SHIP/REVERT/REGEN, post_g for
STAGE_G_THEN_SHIP/STAGE_G_KEEP_EDITS_REGEN. This means a cap-exhausted
run surfaces the iter whose offered text scored highest, not the iter
whose ceiling-of-pre-and-post was highest regardless of which text
shipped.
All other v36.27 behavior is preserved verbatim: STAGE_G_ENABLED stays
False, the score thresholds (SCORE_SHIP=95, SCORE_STAGE_G_LOW=85) are
unchanged, MAX_REGEN_ITERATIONS and the temperature bump schedule are
unchanged, Stage G's internal logic (G1/G2/G3/G4) is unchanged. The
change is entirely in the decision layer between Stage G's output and
the regen loop's accounting.
v36.29 adds a Q3 specificity-preservation gate (revising v36.28; the
Stage G accountability work above remains v36.28's). The graft commit
pass previously had two deterministic backstops after the LLM's COMMIT:
the clean-donor filter (donor free of hard-cap patterns) and the
verbatim-match check. Neither verified that the donor preserved the
concrete specificity of the TOP 1 text it replaced. The v36.28 P63 CH 4
run made the cost measurable: one graft replaced "the shape of a man who
had been holding something for forty-eight hours and was allowed to set
it down" with "A pause that was not hesitation" — clean, continuous, and
7 real Originality points worse (grafted 77 → lineedited 70), because
the AI-baseline register IS the generic low-specificity register. The
gate (_graft_preserves_specificity, run after the clean-donor filter,
same architectural position) is BOOK-AGNOSTIC by design: this is a
fiction-writing system, not a tool for one author or manuscript, so
specificity is measured as a structural property with NO vocabulary
list. Concrete anchors are digit/clock/written numbers, measure-unit
nouns (closed grammatical classes of English), mid-sentence proper
nouns (detected by position, not a name list), and inflected lexical
verbs (regular morphology, light/auxiliary forms discounted). Abstract
nominalizations (-tion/-ment/-ness/-ity/-ence/-ism/... — the closed
morphological class that is the grammatical core of the generic
register) are subtracted at ABSTRACT_NOMINAL_WEIGHT. Every regex and
class generalizes identically across genre and author; nothing
references this project. The gate REJECTS a committed graft when the
donor's structural specificity score keeps fewer than
SPECIFICITY_RETAIN_FRAC (0.5) of the TOP 1 score AND the absolute drop
is at least SPECIFICITY_MIN_ABS_DROP (3). The floor is 3, not 2,
deliberately: the structural proxy is blind to concrete NOUNS (truck,
sternum) because seeing those as concrete needs a lexicon — the exact
dependency the design rejects — so at a drop of ~2 the proxy cannot
distinguish a real subtle loss from its own noun-blindness and must
defer. At a floor of 3 the gate is a reliable coarse net for egregious
loss (the forty-eight-hours regression scores a drop of ~6.5; abstract-
register swaps ~7+) while not overreaching. A documented upgrade hook
in the constant block describes adding a fixed general-English
concreteness norm (Brysbaert et al. 2014) to sharpen the gate and
justify lowering the floor, deferred until real runs show the coarse
gate missing losses that matter. Validated against 7 cases including
two cross-genre (Regency, sci-fi): all correct, with a wide dead zone
(rejections drop 6.5–7.5, passes drop ≤2.0). Rejected grafts land in a
new result["line_graft"]["grafts_rejected_specificity"] bucket surfaced
in the batch summary with the structural scores. The gate is code, not
a prompt instruction, because the May-6 finding established that the
LLM's own "improvement" judgment is precisely what trades strange-
specific prose for cap-compliant generic prose.
v36.30 narrows the v36.29 specificity gate to fix a regression it
caused. The gate's structural concreteness proxy counted digit/clock/
written numbers and measure-unit nouns as concrete anchors. But in this
drafter specific-number/quantity density is the PRIMARY AI fingerprint
(the standing diagnosis: exact-quantity prose runs far above published-
fiction norms and is what drives ORANGE/YELLOW_ORANGE flagging). By
scoring numeric density as protected specificity, the v36.29 gate began
rejecting exactly the donors that strip that fingerprint — i.e. it
shielded the most AI-flagged content type from the grafter's repair. An
export run on the v36.29 build measured the cost: warm-band content
expanded to ~45% with DEEP_ORANGE at ~30% (vs. an ~8% ORANGE baseline),
the warm-flagged text saturated with exact quantities ("clicked every
ninety seconds," "four days old," "forty yards back, maybe fifty"),
scoring 71 against a grafted-77 prior. The fix is one scoped change in
_specificity_score: bare cardinal/quantity anchors (_NUM_DIGIT_RE,
_CLOCK_RE, _WRITTEN_NUM_RE, _UNIT_RE) no longer contribute to the
concreteness count, so the gate is BLIND to numeric density and lets
the grafter clean it. Qualitative concreteness is still protected:
mid-sentence proper nouns and inflected physical verbs still count,
abstract nominalizations are still subtracted, so the motivating v36.28
case (the "holding something for forty-eight hours / set it down" line
vs. "a pause that was not hesitation") is still rejected — that line's
score is carried by its finite physical verbs and the generic
replacement is still penalized for "hesitation," leaving a drop well
above the floor even with the time span no longer counted. The gate's
craft purpose (don't let grafts gut concrete human specificity) is
unchanged; only its conflation of human concreteness with the numeric
AI fingerprint is removed. The four regexes are retained (defined and
documented) so the carve-out is auditable and reversible. No other
constant, threshold, or class changed.
The pipeline answers three questions in order:
  Q1. Is this draft acceptable as prose? A pass/fail quality floor on each
      draft. Voice intact, beats landed, dialogue working, no collapses or
      incoherences. Unacceptable drafts are dropped entirely — not shipped,
      not used as graft donors, not ranked. If zero drafts clear the floor,
      the pipeline halts and reports failure. The floor is lenient: it
      catches drafts you would be embarrassed to ship, not drafts that are
      merely different from the others.
  Q2. Among acceptable drafts, which ships? Commercial-quality ranking leads.
      Only the highest commercial-quality score tier can become TOP 1. The
      evaluator's top-ranked draft in that tier is TOP 1 unless it is a
      scanner outlier — defined as having more than double the batch median
      violation count. In that case the scanner vetoes the pick and the
      next top-quality commercial draft that is not an outlier becomes TOP 1.
      Stage F/local predictions are advisory until the final ship gate.
  Q3. Two-stage graft pass with two pathways and two graft units:
      Stage 1 (identification). Wide-net sweep of all runner-ups. For every
      sentence or clause that serves the same NARRATIVE FUNCTION as some
      text in TOP 1 — characterizing the same subject, marking the same
      interior movement, describing the same object or action — emit a
      candidate. Staging may differ; function must match.
      Stage 2 (commit). Each candidate is judged COMMIT or REJECT against
      three gates: donor is clean of hard-cap patterns, replacement
      preserves continuity with surrounding TOP 1 prose, and the graft
      genuinely improves on the TOP 1 text. Minimal seam edits at the
      boundary are permitted (at most one connecting word per side) and
      logged.
      Two pathways remain:
      Type A — FLAG REPAIR. TOP 1 text carries a flagged construction;
      donor is clean at the same function.
      Type B — QUALITY UPGRADE. TOP 1 text is acceptable but the donor
      is meaningfully better prose at the same function.
      Two units:
      Sentence-level: replace a whole TOP 1 sentence with a donor sentence.
      Phrase-level: replace a clause inside a TOP 1 sentence with a donor
      clause. Phrase grafts let a sharp clause from a divergent scene
      enter TOP 1 without importing the surrounding staging.
      Substitution is deterministic find-and-replace in Python, not an
      LLM pass. The model identifies, judges, and specifies seam edits;
      the code substitutes.
The scanner informs Q2 (veto only) and Q3. The commercial evaluator drives
Q1 and Q2 selection.
Export: top-N acceptable drafts as separate files + TOP1_GRAFTED (when
any grafts applied) + a batch summary naming any rejections.
The generation prompt lives in prompts.csv. The app does not inject its
own drafting instructions.

EVALUATOR_PROMPT = """You are evaluating {N} drafts of the same commercial-fiction chapter against its outline. You have three inputs: the chapter outline, the mechanical scanner results for each draft, and the drafts themselves.
Read every draft in full. Do not skim.

Your job is to do three things in order:
(1) apply a lenient commercial-fiction quality floor so the pipeline knows which drafts are fit to ship at all,
(2) assign each draft a commercial prose-quality score,
and (3) rank only the highest-scoring acceptable draft tier.

The pipeline is QUALITY-FIRST. Your verdict is not an AI-detector ranking. Scanner numbers are useful diagnostic context, but the commercial winner should be chosen for market fitness, scene execution, forward motion, character pressure, dialogue utility, clean genre delivery, and readable sentence movement.

COMMERCIAL-FICTION STANDARD
Reward drafts that:
- move the chapter forward through scene, action, dialogue, decision, pressure, attraction, danger, reveal, investigation, or competence;
- deliver the outline's required beats on the page rather than summarizing them;
- keep the POV voice direct, specific, and readable without literary-critical over-polish;
- use dialogue to move power, information, intimacy, concealment, or conflict;
- maintain paragraph and sentence variety without calling attention to style;
- close with forward pressure rather than a static image or abstract gloss.

Penalize drafts that:
- feel generic, essayistic, over-literary, ornamental, or detached from the commercial premise;
- flatten required scenes into summary;
- let interior explanation displace action and dialogue;
- overuse aphoristic closures, reverse-definition cadences, or decorative comparison;
- violate scanner-capped constructions enough that the prose would need substantial repair.

YOUR METHOD — in this order:
1. WORD COUNTS. Note each draft's word count against any chapter-level target range in the outline. If no target range is supplied, say so; do not invent one.
2. MECHANICAL COMPLIANCE. Use the provided scanner numbers. Do not re-scan. Mention major hard-cap problems, but do not let scanner cleanliness outweigh commercial chapter quality.
3. QUALITY FLOOR — one verdict per draft. Apply a LENIENT commercial standard: mark a draft ACCEPTABLE unless you would be embarrassed to send it to a paying commercial-fiction client. UNACCEPTABLE means one or more of:
   - the required chapter beats are missing, badly compressed, or incoherent;
   - the POV voice collapses into generic narration for long stretches;
   - dialogue reads like exposition instead of dramatic exchange;
   - the chapter fails to arrive at the outline's intended turn or closing pressure;
   - the prose is so flat, ornate, summary-heavy, or mechanically damaged that normal line repair would not rescue it.
   Merely being less elegant than another acceptable draft is NOT grounds for UNACCEPTABLE.
4. QUALITY SCORE — one integer score per draft, on a 1-10 scale, where 10 is the strongest commercial chapter in this batch and 1 is the weakest prose that still functions. Score on commercial chapter fitness: pace, scene delivery, clarity, voice, dialogue, genre obligation, specificity, and reader pull. Use 0 only for UNACCEPTABLE drafts.
5. TOP-TIER RANKING. Rank ONLY the ACCEPTABLE drafts that received the highest QUALITY_SCORE. Omit every acceptable draft below that top score from the RANKING line. If two drafts are genuinely equal at the top, include both in ranked order. If only one draft has the highest score, the RANKING line should contain only that draft.
6. GRAFT CANDIDATES. From non-winning top-scoring drafts, name specific lines or passages worth transplanting into the eventual winner. Prefer Type A flag repairs over subjective style upgrades. Quote a few words for identification and name the beat where each would land.

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each draft, write a paragraph of 3-5 sentences covering commercial fitness, best moment, notable weaknesses, and a one-sentence justification for your quality verdict. Reference the scanner numbers.
Then on a line by itself for each draft:
QUALITY: Draft N — ACCEPTABLE
or
QUALITY: Draft N — UNACCEPTABLE — [one-sentence reason]
Then on a line by itself for each draft:
QUALITY_SCORE: Draft N — S
where S is an integer from 0 to 10. Use 0 only for UNACCEPTABLE drafts.
Then a graft paragraph naming specific lines from non-winning top-scoring drafts worth transplanting, with beat locations.
Then on a line by itself:
RANKING: N, N, N, ...
ONLY the ACCEPTABLE drafts tied at the highest QUALITY_SCORE. Separated by commas.
Then on the final line:
WINNER: N
The winner must be one of the draft numbers on the RANKING line.
Nothing after that line."""

# ============================================================================
LINE_GRAFT_CANDIDATE_PROMPT = """You are comparing {N} drafts of the same chapter. Draft 1 is TOP 1 — the shipping base. Drafts 2–{N} are acceptable runners-up.
Your job is to identify every sentence or clause in the runners-up that could usefully replace a counterpart in TOP 1. This is a wide-net identification pass. Do not commit yet. Commit decisions happen in the next step.
Two kinds of candidate:
TYPE A — FLAG REPAIR. TOP 1's text carries one of the flagged patterns (listed below) and a runner-up has a clean version that does the same narrative function in the scene.
TYPE B — QUALITY UPGRADE. TOP 1's text is acceptable but a runner-up sentence or clause at the same narrative function is meaningfully better — sharper image, more specific physical detail, stronger interior voice, cleaner dialogue. The runner-up version is the one a reader would underline.
GRAFT UNITS. A candidate may be:
- SENTENCE: replace a whole TOP 1 sentence with a donor sentence.
- PHRASE: replace a clause or phrase inside a TOP 1 sentence with a donor clause or phrase. Phrase-level grafts let you import the sharp clause from a donor whose surrounding sentence structure won't fit.
MATCHING RULE. The donor and the TOP 1 text must serve the same NARRATIVE FUNCTION — characterize the same subject, mark the same interior movement, describe the same object or action. Surrounding staging MAY DIFFER; function must be the same. Do not reject a candidate because the scene frames the moment differently — only because the two texts do different work.
CLEAN DONOR REQUIREMENT. The donor text itself must contain ZERO flagged patterns:
- "the way X" observational framing
- Periphrastic observational framing ("as though he were," "like a woman who," "in the manner of," "as a man who")
- "not X but Y" negation pivots in narration (dialogue permitted)
- Named emotions in third-person-like form ("a wave of sadness"); first-person naming in the POV character's interior voice is PERMITTED
- Em-dash over-cap (count exceeds 7 for the whole chapter)
A donor that would introduce a new flag is disqualified. Note any such concern in JUSTIFICATION so the commit pass can address it.

TOP 1 is the shipping base. Below the candidates you will find all {N} drafts. Each candidate proposes replacing some TOP1_TEXT with a DONOR_TEXT from a runner-up.
For each candidate you must decide COMMIT or REJECT.
COMMIT when:
- The graft genuinely improves TOP 1 (clears a flag, or imports a sharper sentence or clause)
- The donor text is clean of all flagged patterns
- Continuity is preserved — the replacement reads naturally with the sentences before and after it in TOP 1
REJECT when:
- The donor text itself carries a flagged pattern ("the way X," periphrastic "as though/like a [person] who/as a man who," "not X but Y" in narration, third-person emotion naming, em-dash over cap)
- The graft breaks continuity with the surrounding TOP 1 prose
- The donor is only marginally different, not meaningfully better
- The function match is superficial — the two texts do different narrative work despite looking similar
SEAM EDITS. If the graft needs a minor adjustment at its boundary — a connecting word added, changed, or removed on either side to preserve grammar or flow — extend the TOP1_TEXT to include the adjusted word, and bake the adjustment into the DONOR_TEXT. Describe what changed in the SEAM_EDITS field. At most one connecting word or short phrase per side. If more is needed, reject the graft.
If the candidate's original TOP1_TEXT or DONOR_TEXT is close but not verbatim to what appears in the drafts, correct it in your output. The final TOP1_TEXT and DONOR_TEXT you emit must match the drafts character-for-character, or the downstream substitution will fail.

Read each draft end to end. Write a craft evaluation in prose, one paragraph per draft, noting what it does well and where the register drifts. Attend to sustained interior voice, whether each per-beat contract item named in the outline lands on the page with the specifics the outline asks for, whether the chapter's emotional channel is open in the beats the outline names for it, and whether the prose carries aphoristic closures, stacked periphrastic observation, or "the way X" constructions that cost the target register.

# v36.32 — new scanner patterns
# ============================================================================
# Three patterns were added in v36.32 to close the gap between the packet's
# 20 hard caps and the 8 the scanner previously enforced. The patterns chosen
# are the ones whose violations Originality.ai was most reliably flagging in
# the v36.31 winning draft (see the export_46 docx analysis):
#
#   • Cap 19 — anaphoric escalation: 3+ sentences within a 5-sentence window
#     sharing the same one or two opening words. Caught by a sentence-level
#     scan (no single regex), implemented in _scan_anaphora() below.
#   • Cap 5 v2 — meta-naming of feelings: "I name it / I named the X". The
#     existing EMOTION_NAMING_PATTERN catches "she felt"/"a wave of"; it does
#     not catch this meta-naming variant. Implemented as a regex.
#   • Cap 14 — negation-as-action: clusters of 3+ "I/he/she (do|did|does|will)
#     not <verb>" architectures within a 6-sentence window. Single instances
#     are permitted (the cap allows ordinary negation when needed for
#     meaning); the cap binds against clusters. Implemented at sentence-list
#     level like Cap 19.
#
# Each pattern feeds (a) a count field in the scan dict, (b) entries in
# scan_flagged_passages so the literary evaluator sees them under
# MECHANICAL COMPLIANCE, and (c) the hard_cap_pass calculation.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Meta-naming: "I name it / the / this / that / my <noun phrase>".
# Anchored on subject "I" + verb "name|named", followed by a definite-article

# Stage G — line-edit pass (mechanical copyedit + AI-tell deletion/graft)
# ============================================================================
#
# Three internal steps run in sequence:
#
#   G1  Mechanical copyedit. One LLM call on the final text with
#       instructions limited to unambiguous punctuation fixes (missing
#       coordinator commas, comma splices, missing apostrophes, missing
#       end-of-sentence punctuation). A word-sequence invariant check
#       rejects the edit if any word was added, removed, or changed.
#
#   G2  AI-tell identification. Deterministic scan over AI_TELL_WORDS. For
#       each flagged word that appears in the text, the containing sentence
#       is captured.
#
#   G3  For each flagged sentence, a three-behavior cascade:
#         a. Same-beat graft. One LLM call looks in the runner-up drafts
#            for a verbatim sentence that does the same narrative work
#            without the flagged construction. If one is found, it replaces
#            the flagged sentence.
#         b. Deletion. If no graft is found, the deletion patterns from
#            AI_TELL_WORDS are applied to the sentence and the a/an article
#            agreement is repaired. If the deletion changed the sentence,
#            the change is applied.
#         c. Rewrite flag. If deletion produced no change, the sentence is
#            recorded in the audit report for manual review; no edit is
#            applied.
#
# Stage G outputs two files:
#   FINAL_<batch_stub>_LINEEDITED.txt  — the edited text, if anything changed
#   LINEEDIT_REPORT_<batch_stub>.txt    — an audit log of every action
#
# Stage G is advisory in the sense that the original FINAL file is not
# overwritten — both remain available. The edited text becomes the basis
# for Stage F's prediction.
# ============================================================================
LINE_EDIT_MECHANICAL_PROMPT = """You are a strict copyeditor. Your job is to fix unambiguous punctuation errors in the text below and nothing else.
Allowed edits:
- Insert a comma before a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) when it joins two independent clauses.
- Fix comma splices (two independent clauses joined by only a comma) by replacing the comma with a semicolon or a period. If you use a period, capitalize the next word.
- Add a missing apostrophe in a contraction or possessive.
- Add missing end-of-sentence punctuation where the sentence structure clearly calls for it.
Forbidden edits:
- Do NOT change, add, remove, or reorder any words.
- Do NOT break a sentence apart or merge sentences, except the comma-splice fix above.
- Do NOT change spelling (British vs American, archaic vs modern).
- Do NOT make stylistic changes, smoothing, or rewording.
- Do NOT touch dialogue or internal quotes unless the fix is an unambiguous punctuation error.

{flagged_sentence}
FLAGGED CONSTRUCTION:
The word or phrase "{flagged_word}" used as an adjective, intensifier, or part of a named-state construction. The replacement must not reintroduce the same word or construction.

G4_MULTI_SENTENCE_PROMPT = """You are running a final mechanical pass over a chapter to remove three specific multi-sentence constructions. Your only operations are: delete a sentence in full, collapse a consecutive run of sentences by deleting the extensions and keeping the first, or leave a passage alone. You may not rewrite, paraphrase, or add new wording.
TARGETS
T1 — NEGATION FIGURE. Two or more consecutive sentences each carrying an explicit negation ("not," "no," "never," "did not," "could not," "would not," "had not," "was not," "is not"). The first sentence does the dramatic work; subsequent sentences function as rhetorical extension or amplification rather than introducing new information. Recognizable by structural parallelism between the sentences and by the absence of new content in the extensions. Do not flag two negation sentences that simply happen to be adjacent and carry independent content; flag only when the second (and any following) reads as scaffolding for the first. Action: keep the first sentence; delete every consecutive negation sentence that functions as extension.
T2 — CLOSING APHORISTIC GLOSS. A scene closes (paragraph break or scene break immediately follows) with an interpretive sentence that names what the scene meant rather than showing it. Common shapes: sentences beginning "It was the kind of...," "It was what...," "That was the X of...," "She/he/I was a woman/man who...," followed by a paragraph break or section break. Action: delete the closing interpretive sentence.
T3 — CLASSIFY-BY-GENRE RESIDUAL. A sentence whose function is to classify a person or thing as belonging to a category — "the kind of [X] that [Y]," "a [noun] who [verbs]," "the [adjective] of a [noun] who" — and whose removal does not leave the surrounding paragraph ungrammatical. Action: delete the classification sentence. If the classification is woven into a sentence whose other content is needed, leave it.
HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Delete only. Never rewrite. Never paraphrase. Never add new wording.
- Do not edit dialogue (anything inside quotation marks).
- Do not delete a whole paragraph. If a paragraph contains only a target sentence, leave it.
- The total word count must remain within 2 percent of the input word count.
- If you are not certain a candidate matches a target, leave it.
OUTPUT FORMAT
Return exactly two sections, in this order, with no other text:
EDITED_TEXT:
<the full chapter, with deletions applied. Preserve all paragraph breaks and other formatting verbatim except where a deletion removes a sentence.>
EDITS:
[
  {{"target": "T1|T2|T3", "deleted": "<verbatim sentence(s) removed>", "kept_neighbor": "<verbatim sentence kept (T1 only) or empty string>"}},
  ...
]
If no edits are warranted, return EDITED_TEXT identical to the input and EDITS as [].

# Originality color ranker — deterministic, no LLM
#
# Background:
#   The mechanical scanner above counts textual patterns in the raw draft
#   before Originality sees it. Its scores do not predict Originality's
#   eventual per-sentence verdicts. Calibration against four v9/v10 samples
#   (47%, 85%, 93%, 99% scorers) showed that the scanner's "cleanest" draft
#   was actually the second-worst scorer, and that Originality's color-coded
#   exports carry a perfectly monotonic signal.
#
# Calibration (hex fill G–R offset → class):
#   g - r >= 15  STRONG_GREEN   (unambiguously human)
#   g - r >=  5  mild_green
#   g - r >= -5  neutral
#   g - r >=-15  mild_orange
#   g - r < -15  STRONG_ORANGE  (unambiguously AI)
#
# Rank score = -(longest_O ** 2) * 3      dominant, superlinear
#              - O_in_multi_clusters        concentration cost
#              - total_O * 0.3              background orange volume
#              + (mild_green - mild_orange) * 0.5  middle-band refinement
#
#   Strong-green count is deliberately ignored: it is non-monotonic with
#   score in the middle range and tends to co-occur with strong orange
#   (the "bimodal composed register" problem). Selecting for strong green
#   actively steers toward worse drafts.

# v36.29: Stage Q3 specificity-preservation gate (book-agnostic)
# ============================================================================
#
# The May-6 finding: the graft commit pass trends toward replacing strange-
# specific constructions with cap-compliant generic ones, because the only
# commit gates were (1) donor clean of hard-cap patterns and (2) donor
# preserves continuity. Neither checks whether the replacement keeps the
# concrete specificity the TOP 1 text carried. The v36.28 P63 CH 4 run made
# this measurable: one graft replaced
#     "the shape of a man who had been holding something for forty-eight
#      hours and was allowed to set it down"
# with
#     "A pause that was not hesitation."
# and cost 7 real Originality points (grafted 77 → lineedited 70). The donor
# was clean and continuous; it was simply far less specific. The AI-baseline
# register IS the generic, low-specificity register, so a graft that strips
# specificity moves the text toward what detectors flag even as it satisfies
# the cap.
#
# This gate is deterministic code, run AFTER the LLM's COMMIT and AFTER the
# clean-donor filter — the same architectural position as
# _donor_sentence_is_clean. It must be code, not a prompt instruction,
# because the LLM's own judgment of "improvement" is exactly the judgment
# the May-6 finding showed cannot be trusted on this axis.
#
# BOOK-AGNOSTIC DESIGN. This is a fiction-writing system, not a tool for one
# author or manuscript. Specificity is therefore measured as a structural
# property, not via any vocabulary list. The signal is the grammatical
# signature the May-6 finding identified: the generic register swaps
# physical images for ABSTRACT NOMINALIZATIONS. "Holding something for
# forty-eight hours / set it down" (finite verbs + a counted time span)
# becomes "a pause that was not hesitation" (two deverbal abstractions).
# That shift is detectable by morphology and part-of-speech role alone,
# with zero word lists, identical on any genre or author:
#
#   CONCRETE anchors (raise specificity):
#     - digit numbers and decimals/comma-grouped (40, 2,600)
#     - clock/calendar forms (9:40, 7 a.m., o'clock)
#     - written-out cardinals/ordinals (forty-eight, third) — a closed
#       grammatical class of English, not a topical lexicon
#     - measure/time unit nouns by suffix+shape — also a closed class
#     - proper nouns: mid-sentence capitalized tokens, detected by
#       position (not sentence-initial) rather than a stopword list
#     - finite lexical verbs (past/3rd-sing/-ing participles) carrying
#       physical action, approximated morphologically
#
#   ABSTRACT markers (lower specificity):
#     - nominalizations by suffix: -tion, -sion, -ment, -ness, -ity,
#       -ence, -ance, -ism, -acy, -ence — a closed morphological class
#       that is the grammatical core of the generic register
#
# The specificity score is (concrete anchors) minus a discounted count of
# abstract nominalizations. The gate REJECTS a committed graft when the
# donor's score falls materially below the TOP 1 score: donor keeps fewer
# than SPECIFICITY_RETAIN_FRAC of the TOP 1 score AND the absolute drop is
# at least SPECIFICITY_MIN_ABS_DROP. Both conditions are required so the
# gate does not fire on anchor-for-anchor swaps or already-spare sentences.
# No constant, regex, or class in this gate references this project.

SPECIFICITY_RETAIN_FRAC = 0.5     # donor must keep >= 50% of TOP1 score
SPECIFICITY_MIN_ABS_DROP = 3      # ...and only fire if the raw drop is >= 3.
                                  # Set to 3 (not 2) deliberately. The
                                  # structural proxy is blind to concrete
                                  # NOUNS (truck, sternum) because seeing
                                  # them as concrete needs a lexicon or
                                  # sense inventory — the exact dependency
                                  # this gate avoids by design. At a drop
                                  # of ~2 the proxy cannot distinguish a
                                  # real subtle specificity loss from its
                                  # own noun-blindness, so it must defer
                                  # there rather than reject. A floor of 3
                                  # keeps the gate a reliable coarse net
                                  # for EGREGIOUS loss (the May-6
